# Contributing Guideline

I will be glad to receive help with the repo. As this repository is for my personal learning I will only accept limited PR. 

- I will accept changes in `ai-resouces.md` organizing links to correct categories, adding relevant links.
- I will accept changes for `paper-implementations` fixing documentations, paper references mistakes and bugs.
- I will not accept changes to `papers.md` at this moment.
